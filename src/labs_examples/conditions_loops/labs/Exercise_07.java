 * Conditions and Loops Exercise 7: First vowel
 * <p>
 * Take in a word from the user and using a "while" loop, find the first vowel in the word.
 * Once you find the vowel, print out the word and the first vowel.
 * <p>
 * Hints:
 * - there are a few helpful methods in the String class called length(), charAt() and indexOf()
 * - you'll likely want to use a String that contains all the vowels:
 * - ie: String vowels = "aeiou";
